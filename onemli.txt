The machine that makes the chips was developed by a fantasy author.
After serving as a combat engineer in the Korean War, Gene Wolfe studied engineering at the University of Houston and eventually landed a job at Proctor & Gamble, where he helped develop the machine that was used to make Pringles. Often credited as the inventor, Wolfe cleared things up in an interview with Lawrence Person: “I developed it. I did not invent it. That was done by a German gentleman whose name I've forgotten for years. I developed the machine that cooks them.” Wolfe would go on to write science fiction novels, one of which was voted the greatest fantasy of all-time behind The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.
