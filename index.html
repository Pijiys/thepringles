      <h2>A Fact About Pringles</h2>
      <p class="fact">
        The machine that makes the chips was developed by a fantasy author.
        After serving as a combat engineer in the Korean War, Gene Wolfe studied
        engineering at the University of Houston and eventually landed a job at
        Proctor & Gamble, where he helped develop the machine that was used to
        make Pringles. Often credited as the inventor, Wolfe cleared things up
        in an interview with Lawrence Person: “I developed it. I did not invent
        it. That was done by a German gentleman whose name I've forgotten for
        years. I developed the machine that cooks them.” Wolfe would go on to
        write science fiction novels, one of which was voted the greatest
        fantasy of all-time behind The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.
